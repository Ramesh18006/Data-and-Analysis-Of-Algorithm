History
Sivakasi was established during the early 15th century CE. Between 1428 and 1460, a Pandya king Harikesari Parakkirama Pandian ruled the southern part of Madurai region (comprising modern-day Sivakasi and its surroundings). Hindu legend relates that he wanted to construct a temple for the Hindu god Shiva at Tenkasi and went to Kasi to bring a lingam (an iconic representation of Shiva). While returning to his palace with the prized lingam, he rested under the grove of a vilva tree, the favourite tree of Shiva. When a cow carrying the lingam refused to move from the spot, the king realised that the wishes of Shiva were different from his own, and he placed the lingam in the place where the cow halted. The place where the "Shiva lingam brought from Kasi" was installed came to be known as Sivakasi.[3][4] Sivakasi was a part of the Madurai region during the 16th century. Madurai became independent from the Vijayanagar Empire in 1559 under the Nayaks.[5] Nayak rule ended in 1736 and Madurai was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib (1740–1754), Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan (1725–1764) in the middle of the 18th century.[6] In 1801, Madurai came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency.[7]

The mutual confrontation between the Maravars and Nadars reached its peak in 1899, leading to a series of riots which became known as the Sivakasi riots. A total of 22 people were killed, as many as 800 houses and the Big Chariot in the center of the city (used by the temple during festivals) were burnt during the riots. Eventually, the riots came to an end after the intervention of the military in mid-July 1899.[8][9][10][11]

The Sivakasi municipality was established in 1920. After India's independence from the British in 1947, Sivakasi continued to be a municipality under the Madras state and later a part of Tamil Nadu, when the state was split on linguistic lines during 1953, 1956 and 1960 and renamed in 1968.[12] It was promoted to a second-grade municipality in 1978, first-grade in 1978, selection-grade in 1998, special-grade in 2013 and proposed to be upgraded as municipal corporation in 2017. On 31-December-2020, both Sivakasi and Thiruthangal are merged with a view to promote Sivakasi as municipal corporation. It is declared as Municipal Corporation on 24-August-2021 in Tamil Nadu legislative assembly.[a][13] Over the decades after independence, Sivakasi grew as an industrial city specialising in firecracker, match and printing industries. Several incidents of fire and explosions have occurred in the fireworks factories.
